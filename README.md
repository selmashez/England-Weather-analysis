London Weather Analysis Project

Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of weather conditions in London, focusing primarily on humidity trends and their correlation with other meteorological parameters such as temperature and wind speed. Utilizing historical weather data, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that could aid in understanding climatic behaviors in urban settings.


Features

Data Cleaning: Implementing strategies to handle missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.

Data Transformation: Converting raw data into meaningful formats, such as transforming numerical month representations into month names.

Statistical Analysis: Employing statistical methods to calculate averages and correlations among different weather parameters.

Visualization: Generating various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to visually represent underlying data distributions and trends.

Data

The dataset primarily includes hourly weather conditions spanning several years. Key columns in the dataset include:


Formatted Date: The timestamp of recorded data.

Temperature: The ambient air temperature.

Humidity: The amount of moisture in the air.

Wind Speed: The observed wind speed at the time of recording.

Methodology

Data Parsing: Convert 'Formatted Date' into a datetime object to facilitate time-based analysis.

Humidity Analysis:

Calculate the average humidity for different times of the day and months of the year.

Analyze the relationship between humidity and other factors like temperature and wind speed.

Handling Outliers: Identify and remove outliers using Z-score computation to enhance the quality of the analysis.

Time Series Analysis: Explore how humidity and other variables behave over time and under different environmental conditions.

Visualizations

Histograms to explore the distribution of humidity and temperature.

Scatter Plots to investigate the relationships between humidity and temperature across different times of the day.

Time Series Graphs to visualize trends and cyclic behavior of weather parameters.
